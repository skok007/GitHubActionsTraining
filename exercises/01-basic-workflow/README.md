# Exercise 01: Basic GitHub Actions Workflow

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create your first GitHub Actions workflow. You'll create a simple Python application and set up a basic CI workflow that runs tests automatically when you push code.

## Objectives

- Create a basic Python application
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow
- Learn about workflow triggers
- Understand basic workflow syntax
- Run tests automatically on push

## Steps

1. **Create a Simple Python Application**
   - Create a new Python file `calculator.py` with basic math functions
   - Create a test file `test_calculator.py`
   - Add requirements.txt for dependencies

2. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Create `.github/workflows` directory
   - Create `python-app.yml` workflow file
   - Define workflow triggers
   - Set up Python environment
   - Run tests

3. **Test Your Workflow**
   - Commit and push your changes
   - Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository
   - Verify that tests are running automatically

## Expected Outcome

After completing this exercise, you should have:
- A basic Python application with tests
- A GitHub Actions workflow that runs automatically on push
- Understanding of basic workflow components
- Experience with GitHub Actions UI

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this exercise, move on to Exercise 02 to learn about environment variables and secrets in GitHub Actions.
