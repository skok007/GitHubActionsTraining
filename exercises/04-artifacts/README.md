# Exercise 04: Artifacts

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use artifacts in GitHub Actions to store and share files between jobs and workflows. You'll create a simple application that generates reports and stores them as artifacts.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of artifacts in GitHub Actions
- Create a workflow that generates and stores artifacts
- Share artifacts between jobs in a workflow
- Download and use artifacts from previous workflow runs
- Set up artifact retention policies

## Steps

1. **Create a Report Generator Application**
   - Create a Python application that generates reports
   - Add functionality to create different types of reports
   - Create a test file to verify the functionality

2. **Set Up Artifact Workflow**
   - Create a workflow file that generates reports
   - Store the reports as artifacts
   - Share artifacts between jobs
   - Download artifacts from previous runs

3. **Implement Artifact Retention**
   - Set up artifact retention policies
   - Configure artifact expiration
   - Handle large artifacts efficiently

4. **Test Your Workflow**
   - Commit and push your changes
   - Check the Actions tab to see the artifacts being generated
   - Verify that artifacts can be downloaded and used

## Expected Outcome

After completing this exercise, you should have:
- An application that generates reports
- A GitHub Actions workflow that stores reports as artifacts
- Understanding of how to share artifacts between jobs
- Experience with artifact retention policies

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this exercise, move on to Exercise 05 to learn about deployment using GitHub Actions.
