# Exercise 05: Deployment

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use GitHub Actions for automated deployment. You'll create a simple web application and set up workflows to deploy it to different environments based on various triggers.

## Objectives

- Understand deployment environments in GitHub Actions
- Create environment-specific configurations
- Set up deployment workflows with approvals
- Implement rollback strategies
- Use deployment protection rules

## Steps

1. **Create a Simple Web Application**
   - Create a Flask web application
   - Add configuration for different environments
   - Create tests for the application
   - Set up Docker containerization

2. **Set Up Deployment Environments**
   - Create staging and production environments in GitHub
   - Configure environment secrets
   - Set up environment protection rules
   - Configure deployment approvals

3. **Create Deployment Workflows**
   - Set up continuous deployment to staging
   - Configure manual deployment to production
   - Implement deployment gates and approvals
   - Add rollback capabilities

4. **Test the Deployment Process**
   - Deploy to staging automatically
   - Request and approve production deployment
   - Test rollback procedures
   - Monitor deployment status

## Expected Outcome

After completing this exercise, you should have:
- A web application with automated deployment
- Multiple deployment environments
- Protected deployment workflows
- Experience with deployment approvals and rollbacks

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed all exercises in this GitHub Actions training. You should now have a good understanding of:
- Basic workflows
- Environment variables and secrets
- Matrix builds
- Artifacts
- Deployment strategies

Continue exploring GitHub Actions by:
- Creating your own workflows
- Contributing to open source projects
- Automating your development processes
