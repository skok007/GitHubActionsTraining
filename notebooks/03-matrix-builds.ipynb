    "## Hands-on Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll create a Python package and set up a matrix build workflow. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Python Package**\n",
    "   - Create a simple Python package with tests\n",
    "   - Add compatibility checks for different Python versions\n",
    "   - Create a setup.py file for packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up Matrix Build Workflow**\n",
    "   - Create a workflow file that uses matrix strategy\n",
    "   - Define Python versions and operating systems to test\n",
    "   - Configure environment variables for each matrix combination\n",
    "   - Add steps to run tests in each environment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimize Your Matrix Build**\n",
    "   - Use matrix exclusions to skip unnecessary combinations\n",
    "   - Implement matrix strategy to reduce the number of jobs\n",
    "   - Add conditional steps based on matrix parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Your Workflow**\n",
    "   - Commit and push your changes\n",
    "   - Check the Actions tab to see the matrix build in action\n",
    "   - Verify that tests run correctly in all environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise, you should have:\n",
    "- A Python package that can be tested across different environments\n",
    "- A GitHub Actions workflow that uses matrix builds\n",
    "- Understanding of how to optimize matrix builds\n",
    "- Experience with conditional steps based on matrix parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed this exercise, move on to Exercise 04 to learn about artifacts in GitHub Actions."
