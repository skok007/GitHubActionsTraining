    "1. **Environment Variables**\n",
    "   - Regular variables that can be set at different levels\n",
    "   - Visible in logs (should not contain sensitive data)\n",
    "   - Can be set at workflow, job, or step level\n",

    "   - Available at repository, environment, or organization level\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contexts**\n",

    "## Hands-on Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll create an application that uses environment variables and secrets. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Configuration Application**\n",
    "   - Create a Python application that reads configuration from environment variables\n",
    "   - Add functionality to connect to a mock API using credentials\n",
    "   - Create a test file to verify the functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**\n",
    "   - Add repository secrets in GitHub\n",
    "   - Understand the different types of secrets (repository, environment, organization)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**\n",
    "   - Create a workflow that uses environment variables\n",
    "   - Implement secure handling of secrets\n",
    "   - Pass environment variables between jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Your Workflow**\n",
    "   - Commit and push your changes\n",
    "   - Verify that secrets are properly masked in logs\n",
    "   - Check that the application works with the provided environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise, you should have:\n",
    "- An application that uses environment variables\n",
    "- A GitHub Actions workflow that securely handles secrets\n",
    "- Understanding of different types of GitHub Secrets\n",
    "- Experience with passing environment variables between jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed this exercise, move on to Exercise 03 to learn about matrix builds in GitHub Actions."
