    "\n",
    "2. **Development Environment**\n",
    "   - Basic understanding of Git\n",
    "   - Text editor for editing YAML files\n",
    "   - Familiarity with command-line interfaces\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A GitHub Actions workflow consists of several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Events**\n",
    "   - Triggers that start the workflow\n",
    "   - Examples: push, pull_request, schedule\n",
    "   - Can be filtered by branches, paths, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Jobs**\n",
    "   - Units of work that run in parallel or sequentially\n",
    "   - Each job runs in a fresh instance of the virtual environment\n",
    "   - Can have dependencies on other jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Steps**\n",
    "   - Individual tasks within a job\n",
    "   - Can run commands or use actions\n",
    "   - Share data between steps\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Actions**\n",
    "   - Reusable units of code\n",
    "   - Can be created by GitHub, the community, or you\n",
    "   - Accept inputs and produce outputs"
